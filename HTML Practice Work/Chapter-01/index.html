    <!-- Explaining HTML Structure -->
    
    <h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>
    
    <p>Anything within the body of a web page is displayed in the main browser window.</p>
    
    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    
    <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be   split up into several sub-headings.<p>
    
        <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    
        <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).</p>
    
        <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    
        <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
